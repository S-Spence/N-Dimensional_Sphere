"""This script was used for a discussion in multivariable calculus. The discussion prompt asked us to consider why a sphere's volume 
decreases beyond 5-dimensions in multi-dimensional space. We were also asked to calculate the surface area of the sphere in n-dimensions.
I used python to automate these calculations with two recursive algorithms."""
